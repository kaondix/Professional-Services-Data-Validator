# BASH DVT Utility Scripts

## auto_partition.sh

This script will execute DVT's [generate-table-partitions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services-data-validator?tab=readme-ov-file#generate-partitions-for-large-row-validations) feature and then execute the partitions based on the resources of the local VM and the size of the table being validated. This approach is an alternative to the [main options to scale DVT usage](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services-data-validator?tab=readme-ov-file#scaling-dvt).

It makes the following assumptions:

- A row --hash validation is the desired validation type.
- The parallel validation will run on the current host (where this script is executing).
- All local CPU resources are for this process to use in full.
- All available RAM on the host is for this process to use in full.

In essence the script will validate the table in small enough partitions to not exceed available memory and in enough parallel streams to max out available vCPUs.

To use the script please edit the following variables:
```
SRC="ora"
TRG="pg"
BQRH="--bq-result-handler=some-project.dvt_dataset.results"
```

### Examples

#### 1 million rows

Validate a 1m row table on a host with 4 vCPUs and > 30GB available RAM.
```
$ ./auto_partition.sh -t dvt_test.tab_vol_1m -c 1000000 -i id
```

Output:
```

```

Notes:
- The table was small enough to validate in a single pass but because there are 4 vCPUs available it was split into 4 partitions
- The validation took just over 1 minute

#### 20 million rows

Validate a 20m row table on a host with 4 vCPUs and only 4GB available RAM. Requesting parallelism of 8, 2 DVT processes per vCPU.

Notes:
- We requested 2 DVT processes per vCPU and therefore it ran 8 DVT partitions concurrently
- Because of low memory availability, 4GB, the table was split into 64 partitions
- The 64 partitions will take 8 passes to be processed
- The validation took 14 minutes

#### 100 million rows

Validatate a 100m row table on a host with 4 vCPUs and only 30GB available RAM, requesting parallelism of 8, 2 DVTs per vCPU.

Notes:
- We requested 2 DVT processes per vCPU and therefore it ran 8 DVT partitions concurrently
- Because there was plenty of memory available, 30GB, the table was split into 40 partitions
- The 40 partitions will take 5 passes to be processed
- Validation of the 100m row table took 1 hour 45 minutes (your mileage may vary)
- The auto_partition.sh script stored all results in BigQuery (100m entries) which takes some time. We could use --filter-status=fail for a faster validation
